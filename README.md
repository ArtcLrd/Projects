The Underground Automated Parking System (U.A.P.S.) provides a solution to parking issues in urban or central business district (CBD) areas. With more personal vehicles and limited space for storage, issues such as traffic congestion, illegal parking, accidents, and blocked roads have become more prevalent. Traditional parking facilities do not offer services like pre-booking or safety measures for personal vehicles. Artificial Intelligence (AI) can detect and verify vehicle number plates, streamlining parking slot bookings with minimal user interaction. AI also detects unauthorized vehicles, illegal entry, and car theft, ensuring the safety and security of parked vehicles and reducing worry for vehicle owners.    
Disasters, whether natural or man-made, can be dangerous when they occur in enclosed environments. Our system is designed to detect and prevent potential disasters, such as fires, floods, and other hazardous incidents. By leveraging advanced technology and sophisticated algorithms, the system can promptly mitigate any risk of harm to the property and vehicles within it.    
Our system uses AI to simplify the process of booking a parking slot. We have created an easy-to-use Application that allows vehicle owners to reserve their spot in advance. When a vehicle arrives, our AI-powered system checks whether the slot has been pre-booked or not using advanced machine learning algorithms. This helps to minimize waiting times by segregating vehicles and ensuring a smooth parking experience. The Application also allows for real-time availability checks of nearby parking systems.    
Our top priority at U.A.P.S is to ensure the satisfaction of vehicle owners, enabling them to leave their vehicles in our lot with confidence as they go about their work.
